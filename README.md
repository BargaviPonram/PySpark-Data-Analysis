```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd pyspark-data-analysis
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
